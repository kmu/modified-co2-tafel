There are two datasets in the figure, but the plot does not have enough
resolution on the y-axis to properly pin down the values of the first three
points. they all show up as identically zero when digitized. I made an attempt
to try reconstructin gthe first three points of the black dataset from the
inset log plot, but I could not get the points to match up, and hence I simply
excluded the black dataset.
